        sticky-state semantics — only the agent text reaches the

          its optimistic bubble with the real DB id + timestamp).
        * ``{"type": "delta", "text": "..."}`` as the agent streams.
        * ``{"type": "classified", ...}`` / ``{"type": "contact", ...}``
          when the respective tool fires.
        * ``{"type": "complete", "result": {...},
            "assistant_message": {...}}`` terminal event with the full
          TriageResult payload (matches the existing /chat response
          shape) and the freshly-persisted assistant DB row.
