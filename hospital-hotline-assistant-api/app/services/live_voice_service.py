"""Gemini Live API voice-call lifecycle manager.

Bridges a frontend WebSocket to ADK's bidirectional ``Runner.run_live``
streaming. Per call:

Debug knobs:
    LIVE_DEBUG_EVENTS=true  Dumps every ADK live event's interesting
                            attributes to the logger. Use to discover
                            the exact shape of new event types (tool
                            calls, transcripts, audio frames) when
                            something downstream isn't firing.


* Validates the hotline ``session_id`` against Postgres.
* Opens a ``LiveRequestQueue`` and binds it to the live ADK runner.
* Sends a kickoff prompt so the agent greets the caller immediately
  (Gemini Live waits for input before producing output otherwise).
* Streams audio bytes back to the caller as the agent speaks.
* Surfaces live caller / agent transcripts and emergency tool calls
  through user-supplied callbacks so the WebSocket route can forward
  them to the frontend.
* Persists the accumulated caller transcript into the text triage
  pipeline so DB rows and the mock notifier still fire — both
  mid-call (on emergency detection) and on final disconnect.

The Gemini Live API itself emits audio + transcription events; we do
not run STT ourselves. The text-mode chat path is left untouched —
this service only adds a new entry point for voice.
